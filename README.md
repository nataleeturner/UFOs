# UFOs

## Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to create awareness of UFO sightings. To do this, a website was created where interested users can search through and read a brief description of a plethora of UFO sightings. There is an added ability to filter through the data in order to find UFO sightings in areas might be more interesting to the user.

## Results
In order to use this website and filter through the data, you just need to find the “Filter Search” section and click in the box for each filter that you’d like to include in your search. There is an example of what the text input should look like for each filter already included in the box. For example, if you’d like to just look at the UFO sightings in Canada, you can type “ca” into the Country filter box. Alternatively, if you’d like to look at the sightings in California that occurred on 1/1/2010 you would type “ca” in the state filter box and “1/1/2010” in the date filter box. See the screen shot below that shows where these filters are located and the example text in each filter box.

## Summary
One drawback of the updated filter design is that you must input the text in the exact way that it is listed in the table for the filter to work correctly. In order to do this, one would have to scroll through the table to know what they want to filter on. A better design would be to have a drop-down menu with the options that can be chosen to filter the table. However, this could create a very long list so the drop-down menu would need to also update if the user began typing a word and it would also need to update based on other filters that have already been added. For example, if the date filter was already filled in, the city filter drop-down menu would only include city options that fall within the date filter.

One more possible change that would make the filters more user friendly would be to have two buttons instead of the current text box country filter, since the only country options are US and CA. Allowing for any input in this field is useless.
